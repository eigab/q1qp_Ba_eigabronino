        <h2> Conclusion:</h2>
        <P>As we examine the average screen time of high school students, focusing on 14-15-year-olds, primarily females. The primary device used for screen time was smartphones, accounting for 78.8% of the students, followed by laptops or PCs at 17.3%. The most students have a screen time duration of 5.5 hours, with 28.8% falling within this category, and 7.5 hours coming in second, with 26.9% reporting this screen time duration. The analysis of this data offers valuable insights into the screen time habits of high school students and raises important considerations for educators and parents.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, the study has potential limitations, such as the data source not fully representing the entire high school student population in the Philippines, self-reporting being subject to recall bias, and not delved into the content or context of screen time. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, content and context analysis, comparative studies, and intervention strategies to promote responsible and healthy screen time habits among high school students. By understanding the extent of screen time among students and its potential consequences, we can better address the challenges associated with screen use in modern times and ensure the well-being and academic success of students.
