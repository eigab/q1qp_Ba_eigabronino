            <p>Google Forms is a versatile tool that can efficiently collect information from 52 students across different schools. It offers easy data collection through customizable forms with various types of questions, such as multiple-choice and short answer. The tool also provides distributed access, allowing students to access and fill out the form from anywhere with an internet connection.
                <br>
                Responses can be viewed in real-time, allowing for tracking progress and efficient data collection. Google Forms automatically collates responses into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, making it easy to organize and analyze the collected data. Customized design can be made to match school branding or specific themes, making the form more engaging and personal.
                <br>
                Form logic can be set up to tailor questions based on responses, making it useful for specific student questions. Google Forms is secure and can be set to collect data anonymously or with a level of anonymity. Time management can be set to ensure responses are collected within a specified period.
                <br>
                Google Forms can be shared and collaborated on with colleagues or educators who may also need access to the collected data. After data collection, data can be exported to various formats, including CSV and Excel, for reporting or sharing.
                <br>
                Mobile accessibility is another advantage of Google Forms, allowing students to fill out the forms on their mobile devices, making it convenient for them to participate even when on the move. Overall, Google Forms is an effective and user-friendly tool for collecting data from multiple participants.</p>
